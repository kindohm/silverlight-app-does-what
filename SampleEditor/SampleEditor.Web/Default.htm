            <strong>Instructions</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click 'Record' and use your microphone to record an audio clip. Recording will stop
                either when you click 'Stop' or after 1 MB of audio data has been recorded.</li>
            <li>Click 'Play' to listen to your clip. The clip will loop and play infinitely until
                you click 'Stop'</li>
            <li>Click and drag on the graph to draw a selection around a portion of your your audio
                clip. This will loop only that selection during playback. </li>
            <li>After recording your voice, try selecting and playing a small region in the middle
                of your clip for absolute silliness. Quiet, transient sounds are sometimes the most
                fun.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the app doesn't seem to be working, first make sure that you have a microphone
                attached to your computer. You <em>must</em> have a microphone attached to your
                computer for this app to work.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble recording or hearing the audio during playback, try right-clicking
                on the graph above and choose "Silverlight", then click the Webcam/Microphone tab
                and make sure you have some default devices set up. This check seemed to fix problems
                for a few other people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Have fun!</p>
